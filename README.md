## What is it?
It's a draft of an alternative template for the new social network [Pinkary](https://pinkary.com/) by [Nuno Maduro](https://github.com/nunomaduro).

## Why?
I find this project super interesting, and I wanted to make my small contribution. The theme is based on the official one, but with slight adjustments to typography and spacing.  
This is just a draft, but if there's interest, I'd love to continue working on it!

## Technologies
The pages are completely static and serve only as layout drafts.

## I have a question!
Sure thing! Drop me a line at hub@marcomezzavilla.com â˜º
